                    <h2> The early years</h2>

                        <p> 
                            I spent six years studying Art in school, recieved a Level Two certificate in Protfolio building in Derry IT and recieved a B1 in my leaving cert exam. During my early years I was constantly drawing and painting! Art ran in the blood as I was surrounded by creativity in my family. I think my artistic flare really began to flourish during Transition Year back in school. During Transition Year, I was involved in a fashion compeition which challenges you to create using everyday trash!

                            </br></br>

                            This was where I first discovered how creative you can really be, if you put your mind to it! My friend, Chloe and I, decided to make a dress out of a table for the competition which was gas craic!

                <h2>Art throughout Univeristy</h2>

                    <p>
                        Even though I had built a portfolio and was applying to Art Colleges, I didn't go to study art. I was told by many that there was just no future in it, no way of making any money so, I decided to go to  <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/" target="_blank"><stong>National University of Ireland, Galway</stong></a> instead to study Performing Arts with English and History. 
                        </br>

                        I soon found myself walking into audition rooms and tumbling head first, into the creative world of the wonderful Drama society there known as Dramsoc. Before I knew it, I was saying yes to being involved in any show I could get my hands on be it in costume design, set design, make-up design, directing and even writing and movement direction!
                        </br>
                        Aswell as all these wonderful opportunites the Dramsoc Committee had so many other roles to try and I was determined to nab the roles of Public Relations. I then went on to be Public Relations Officer on three seperate occasions in NUIG where I learned so many new skills in grahic design, social media management, video editing and essentially, ignited my love for art once again.

Keeps going to the right inside the browswer and I can't get the external css stylesheet to change it. Tried div.container and using the class but no joy. Will try learn for next assignment -->
